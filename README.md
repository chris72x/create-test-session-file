# create-test-session-file
This PowerShell script accepts a csv as an input file, manipulates the data and format, and saves it as another file, ready to upload to a testing service.

The first csv file was exported from an information system and the resulting file will be uploaded to a testing website.  Headers will be renamed and reordered, cell contents will be created based on the values of other cells, and static information will be added as necessary.
